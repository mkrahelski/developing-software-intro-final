# Marking Criteria 
### Developing Software: Introduction 
#### Focus College Advanced Certificate Software Development 2020 

<br/>
<br/>

Hello Students! 

In this document I’m going to outline the marking criteria and scoring methods used for the assignments and the final assessments. 

There are 4 assignments you will get through this course, each on the last teaching day of this course that will be due before the next class in the following week. Each assignment will use the result of the assignment from the week prior. You are welcome to make changes to a prior assignment’s code in subsequent assignments. 

Your final assessments will use the results of the assignments. 

| Weekly Assignment | Points | Percent of Final Grade
| --- | --- | --- |
Assignment 1: Gerald’s House | 100 | 5% 
Assignment 2 | 200 | 10% 
Assignment 3 | 300 | 15% 
Assignment 4 | 400 | 20% 
Final Assessments | 1000 | 50% 

<br/> 
Each assignment starts with the total number of points and then has values subtracted based on errors or omissions. 

<br/> 
<br/> 

## Logistics Criteria 

These criteria items are reduced by a percentage of the assignment points. 

| Criteria | Points Reduced | 
| --- | --- |
Late Submissions by 1 Day | -20% 
Late Submissions by over 1 day | Not Accepted 
Late Submissions that are obvious copies of walkthrough | Not Accepted 
| A program that cannot:<br/>Be compiled using the ‘tsc’ command <br/>Run using the npm start command <br/>Run node dist/index.js command | -20% |
| A program handed in that doesn’t attempt the problem in a meaningful way. | -100% |

<br/>
If you don’t understand the assignment, PLEASE reach out in the General channel of this class in Teams. Other students, or myself, will be able to point you in the right direction. 

<br/>
<br/>

### Example 

The last criteria, “A program handed in that doesn’t attempt the problem in a meaningful way”, may be done intentionally, but mis-understanding the assignment can end up in this segment.  

For example: 

If an application assignment is to define a function that adds two numbers, and the submission looks like: 

```javascript
console.log( 4 + 4 ); 
```

This doesn’t attempt the problem in a meaningful way. Understanding the assignment is crucial to the success of this course and each assignment, so if the expected result doesn’t make sense to you – speak up and you’ll get clarification. 

<br/>

## Coding Criteria 

Each assignment will have criteria marked either MAJOR or MINOR criteria. In your last assignment, all criteria were considered MAJOR when I assigned it, but I downgraded some items before I marked for your benefit. Further assignments will have clearly marked MAJOR and MINOR criteria. Criteria may move from MAJOR to MINOR criteria, or vice-verse, between assignments. 

<br/>

### Major Criteria 

Each MAJOR marking criteria missed will subtract POINTS (not percent) on a scale: 

| Occurance | Points Reduced |
| --- | --- |
| First criteria failure | -8 Points |
| Second criteria failure | -12 Points |
| Third criteria failure | -16 Points |
| Subsequent criteria failures | -20 Points each |

<br/>

### Minor Criteria 

Each MINOR marking criteria missed will subtract POINTS (not percent) on a scale: 

| Occurance | Points Reduced |
| --- | --- |
| First criteria failure | -2 Points  |
| Subsequent criteria failures | -4 Points each |

<br/>

## Bonus Points 

BONUS Points will be added if you use any programming feature that hasn't been taught and not added into criteria. They must be used correctly to get bonus points. No points will be subtracted for using them incorrectly; however, if by using it another marking criterion fails, that criteria will still lose points. Bonus points are +8 for each concept (not each usage), at my discretion, and must actually be used to further the goal of the assignment. Available concepts for bonus points will not be disclosed as the list is quite endless.
